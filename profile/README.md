# The DRS Official Organization 

This is the official github DRS organization.
We strive for the equal representation of all triads, as our music teacher is strongly against diminished chords.

## About

The [Society for Panchordal Equality and Justice for Diminished Chords](https://diminished-rights.onrender.com), or the Diminished Rights Society for short, or the DRS for shortER, is a organization that, as the name suggests, tries to get Panchordal Equality and Justice for Diminished chords.

## Our Website

HOWEVER, we are using [onRender](https://dashboard.render.com) to host our FULLSTACK website from this github organization, so check it out [here](https://diminished-rights.onrender.com)!
